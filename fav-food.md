**Tuesday May 26, 2020**

As you know, Covid-19 has turned my _food blog_ into more of a _cooking vlog_. As we always say here on fav foods, "\(ãƒ„) OH WELL HONEY BUNS!". Though the negatives \- outweight the \+ we press on! 

## Today's food of the week is... <br />  GRILLED CHEESE ~~~ BABYYYY!

_YourDictionary.com_ defines a grilled cheese as:
>Noun
>(plural grilled cheeses)
>(North America, colloquial) A grilled cheese sandwich: a cheese sandwich typically toasted or fried in butter.

Helpful cooking tips

1. Use mayonaise instead of butter. _God made Man, Man made Mayo_ it's the cirle of life people.
2. Start your heat low then crank that bad boy up high. 
3. Stank it up! Pair a funky cheese with your cheddar to spice up your life.

That's been your **fav food** entry of the week. Come back next week as we dive into pickled cucumbers. <br>I promise it will be a _vlassic_!
